# 328. Odd Even Linked List

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return *the reordered list*.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
```



```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        odd = odd_head = ListNode(0)
        even = even_head = ListNode(0)
        idx = 1
        while head:
            if idx % 2:
                odd.next = head
                odd = odd.next
                head = head.next
            else:
                even.next = head
                even = even.next
                head = head.next
            idx += 1
        even.next = None
        odd.next = even_head.next
        return odd_head.next
