# 133. Clone Graph

Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

 

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

**Example 1:**

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png" alt="img" style="zoom: 25%;" />

```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```





## bfs

- 这里的visited的key是原来的node，value是想要copy的node

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
"""

class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node:
            return node
        #key: node; value: neighbor list
        visited = {}
        q = collections.deque()
        q.append(node)
        visited[node] = Node(node.val, [])
        while q:
            n = q.popleft()
            for neighbor in n.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val, [])
                    q.append(neighbor)
                # 这里必须要用visited[neighbor]而不是neighbor的原因是visited的value的node的neighbors必须是新生成的neighbor，这些neighbor之后也会被更新，因为是被作为对象传入的
                visited[n].neighbors.append(visited[neighbor])
        #返回一开始的node对应的新copy的node
        return visited[node]
```



## dfs

- 跟bfs原理一样，但这里是直接在遍历neighbor的时候就直接返回了一个已经遍历好的node

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
"""

class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        visited = {}
        
        def cloneNode(node):
            if not node:
                return node
            if node in visited:
                return visited[node]
            clone_node = Node(node.val, [])
            visited[node] = clone_node
            if node.neighbors:
                clone_node.neighbors = [cloneNode(n) for n in node.neighbors]
            return clone_node
        
        return cloneNode(node)
        
```
