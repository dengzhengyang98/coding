# 40. Combination Sum II

Given a collection of candidate numbers (`candidates`) and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to `target`.

Each number in `candidates` may only be used **once** in the combination.

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
Output: 
[
[1,1,6],
[1,2,5],
[1,7],
[2,6]
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5
Output: 
[
[1,2,2],
[5]
]
```



## backtracking

- 先用counter统计，然后转化成[[数字，次数]，[数字，次数]]的形式
- backtracking的时候对counter进行遍历，如果freq为0，就continue到下一个counter的element，每次加入元素到comb时都要更新counter，pop出元素也要更新counter

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum2(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:

        def backtrack(comb, remain, curr, counter, results):
            if remain == 0:
                # make a deep copy of the current combination
                #   rather than keeping the reference.
                results.append(list(comb))
                return
            elif remain < 0:
                return

            for next_curr in range(curr, len(counter)):
                candidate, freq = counter[next_curr]

                if freq == 0:
                    continue

                # add a new element to the current combination
                comb.append(candidate)
                counter[next_curr] = (candidate, freq-1)

                # continue the exploration with the updated combination
                backtrack(comb, remain - candidate, next_curr, counter, results)

                # backtrack the changes, so that we can try another candidate
                counter[next_curr] = (candidate, freq)
                comb.pop()

        results = []  # container to hold the final combinations
        counter = Counter(candidates)
        # convert the counter table to a list of (num, count) tuples
        counter = [(c, counter[c]) for c in counter]
        backtrack(comb = [], remain = target, curr = 0,
                  counter = counter, results = results)

        return results
```
