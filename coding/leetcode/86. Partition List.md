# 86. Partition List

Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes **less than** `x` come before nodes **greater than or equal** to `x`.

You should **preserve** the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
Output: [1,2]
```



```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
        before = before_head = ListNode(0)
        after = after_head = ListNode(0)
        while head:
            if head.val < x:
                before.next = head
                before = before.next
            else:
                after.next = head
                after = after.next
            head = head.next
        # 由于after只是指向linkedlist里的一个node，after.next会指向linkedlist里该node的下一个元素，所以必须设置一个None来结束
        after.next = None
        before.next = after_head.next
        return before_head.next

```
